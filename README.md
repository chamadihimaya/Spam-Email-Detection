Spam Email Classification

This project focuses on spam email classification using natural language processing and machine learning. The dataset is preprocessed to clean and tokenize the text, and feature extraction is performed using the TfidfVectorizer. Four classifiers—Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression—are trained and evaluated. The models demonstrate strong performance, with the SVM classifier standing out with a 99% accuracy, precision, and F1 score. The provided code, along with visualizations, allows users to understand and implement email classification in their projects effectively.
